Python game
This will be our version of the ancient game of Mastermind.

## The Game
* The codemaker picks 4 pegs out of the six different colours and place them behind the visor. You're allowed to place multile pegs in one colour.
* The codebreaker (this is you!) places four pegs on the first row.
* Now the codemaker uses the red/black pins to state how many pegs are both the right colour AND in the right place.
* Uses the white pins to state pegs in the right colour but in the wrong place.
* The codebreaker guesses again accordingly and continues to do so in as little turns as possible until the code is broken.
